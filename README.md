# codeless
Just a collection of PHP snippets, I am tired of not having things at hand.

A lot of this code will be messy, and i am sure there are smarter ways of going about things, I am interested in your thoughts.

A lot of this code was written to serve my purpose or as a proof of concept only, if something doesn't suit what you're after then give me a ping, or fork it off and i'll merge.
